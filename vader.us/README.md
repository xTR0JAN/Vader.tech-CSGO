# supremacy
Supremacy Counter-Strike: Global Offensive cheat, by https://interwebz.cc/. Good for learning, everything is commented. Open Source.

--- Why this is released

Since the source has been going around awhile, and people thinking they're cool because they have this source I decieded to release it.
It's 90% a skeet paste, and the source should be good for people to learn from. Another thing is, people were literally trying to sell this source, and sell cheats based from this. If you do that, you're basically scamming people, don't do that, thanks.

--- Note for morons

Compile in Release x86
"Previous IPDB not found, fall back to full compilation" is normal, it takes awhile to compile, just wait and be patient.  

--- Information on making of the hack

The cheat was mainly composed of getting skeet users to dump the cheat modules, and then reversing the cheat(skeet), and implementing their functions into Supremacy. The menu was designed to make esoterik mad, and he ultimately ending up cracking the cheat due to lack of modern security.
